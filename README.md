# Visualising Social Media Data

This is the repository for my Honours Project with Edinburgh Napier University. The project is based on the comparison of two unsupervised clustering algorithms when looking at Twitter data.

### How it works

The data for the project was collected from TweetSets (https://tweetsets.library.gwu.edu/) containing de-hydrated versions of tweets on different topics. To retrieve the information from the tweets, a developer Twitter account is required allowing access to the Twitter API. This can be done through the use of a Hydrator such as the DocNow Hydrator (https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator).

The application currently cleans the twitter data before it creates visualisations depending on which algorithm the user selects to run.
